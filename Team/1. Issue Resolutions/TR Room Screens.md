### XiO Cloud Resolution:

> XiO Cloud settings take precedence over local settings. [XiO Cloud Help](../../Team/2.%20Information/Crestron%20OLH%20Links.md#XiO%20Cloud)

```
Issue 1:
- No network fix available as screen loses communication 
```

```
Issue 2:
- If the fix of turning off and on via the touchpanel works:
- You could access the Xpanel and turn it off and on
- You could access the remote control in XiO (though much slower)
```

### Local Resolution:
```
Issue 1:
- Unplug and plug in TV
- Wait a few moments
- Press power button on side of screen.
- You will see the android logo and screen will start
- Issue resolved.
```

```
Issue 2:
- Power off and on via touchpanel
- If this doesn't resolve it, try:
- Unplug and reseat the HDMI cable in the side of the screen
- Issue resolved
