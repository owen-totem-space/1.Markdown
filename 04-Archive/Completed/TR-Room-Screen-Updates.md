Update all apps on screens in TR Rooms.
Attempt to stop disconnections from cp3 program
A lot of Sony Bravia advice re: crashing/black screens, is around apps causing the crashes.

## Task List

- Disabled Bluetooth
- Disabled all inputs except HDMI 1
- Disabled screen logo (hdmi 2)
- Disabled remote/tv buttons - to use screen with remote, enter pro mode code on remote
- Change default input to HDMI 1
- All rooms on HDMI 1
- Web XPanel available at CP3 controller IP address
- Switch all cameras to 50/100Hz

## Information

For future reference. If all screens are online, export pro settings file for other screens. This should be the way screens are managed. All configs can be controlled this way.
