## Description

Having played with Crestron Construct enough to know it's limitations, it appears to be useful enough to use for web xpanels for room remote control.

- My plan is create a web xpanel for each room that I have made the program for.
- Easier to remotely schedule turning on and off a room
- Faster interaction than what's available on XiO Cloud

This requires building the GUI and adding the functionality into the program of each room.
