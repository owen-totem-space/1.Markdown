# Audio-Accessibility-Report


**Audio Accessibility System**

**Goals**

-          Assess practical challenge of providing a “no touch”, always-on system to provide hearing assistance in lecture rooms.

-          Get costing of such a system.

-          Find pros and cons related to day to day use for end users.

**Future Questions**

-          Can IT integrate the hearing assistance system on the college network?

-          How can signage be provided for use of QR codes related to this system?

-          How to provide access for people with hearing aids to purchase neck worn induction loop

**Practical challenge**

-          Ensuring all audio systems have the correct gain signal structure and signal routing.

-          Do the audio systems have capacity to provide another signal output to the device?

-          Getting network points to required rooms.

-          Organising with IT to have app running on network.

-          Good security options with the ability to change access codes.

-          Relatively easy physical installation. Setting up backend software, wifi access and signage would require communication between Media Services, IT and estates and possibly student services. Changes to security options would require speedy interaction between these departments again.

**End User Pros**

-          For users who may have hearing issues but do not use hearing aids, this would be a great system to allow them to use equipment they already have (a mobile phone and headphones) to improve their experience within a lecture theatre.

-          Up to 100 users can use a single system at one time.

-          Very simple to use and requires no interaction with a person to request access to use the system.

**End User Cons**

-          People with hearing aids would be required to have their own neck worn induction receiver. I’m not currently aware of widespread use of these kind of systems. If these systems were not in place in most large lecture theatres, how practical is it to expect someone to purchase their own?

-          If it’s not running on the college network, it may not be a viable option. An isolated wifi network without internet connected to it is not a viable option as some phones will disconnect automatically if internet is not detected.
