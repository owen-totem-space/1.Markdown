## Description
Install stage box under the large lectern in the Desmond theatre. The podium has been flagged to be redesigned to a smaller form. It will be put on wheels to facilitate it being moved more often. In an effort to facilitate this and protect the infrastructure we have decided to install a stage box under the lectern.

__Purpose__
- To prevent physically touching and plugging the direct cables to the booth
- To make reinstalling the podium easier

## Wiring Changes

DM Matrix
- Input 13 -> Output 3 (Foldback Monitors)
- Input 14 -> Output 6 (Camera Capture Card)

## Foldback Monitors
We installed two Cat6 cables running from under the lectern to the foldback monitor nearest the booth. This is now providing a direct wired connection to the foldback monitors.
