## Description

- Replace the Polycom Soundstructure with a QSC DSP
- Replace the DM Matrix with similar or NVX

###### Purpose
- Soundstructure had it's power supply replaced once and we have no redundancy
- The soundstructure units are pretty old and hard to replace
- We will keep this unit as redundancy for other rooms
- Have a backup plan in place if the DM Matrix goes down

## Task List

- [x] Investigate NVX vs. DM Matrix replacement
- [ ] Get work permits for ISS
- [x] contact ISS about UCI for QSC
