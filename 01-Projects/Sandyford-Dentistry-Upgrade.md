## Description

- Look at Sandyford quote and see if it's suitable
- Should any of it be changed to Crestron equipment?

###### Purpose
Having switchers, screens, controllers, touchpads accessible through XiO Cloud allows us to monitor the state of a room and it's devices and potentially troubleshoot and solve issues remotely, regardless of any specific control programming or external software.

Below, the extron devices listed can easily be switched out for crestron devices. It's not always an exact one to one match [^1]. Except for some devices [^2] that have a very specific feature, it's always going to be better to use crestron devices in RCSI. The cost difference is minimal, if any, in most cases.

Unless there is something I'm not aware of, I see no reason why the devices below should not be swapped out. If it's a case of changing one or two cable plans or adding a couple of receivers, the advantages we receive by having the crestron devices far outweighs any other conveniences.

[^1]: although in this case, it's very close if not exact 
[^2]: perhaps the Extron SMP 111 listed on this quote
