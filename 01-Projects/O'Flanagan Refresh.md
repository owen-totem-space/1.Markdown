## Proposed New Equipment

- [DM Lite 8x2 Switcher €3350](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/DigitalMedia-Switchers/Fixed-Switchers/HD-PS622)

> The HD-TX-4KZ-421-CHGR would cover all inputs down at podium and desk. Arguably the dock does al that at the moment.


> Switcher could provide second output for foldback or recording if needed. A DA would probably suffice for the time being though.


> One receiver for the projector and to provide control to it.
> One receiver for foldback screen on stage,
