## Podium
- Mount Laptop Dock in better position inside podium
- Loom and clean cables inside podium
- [ ] Mounting Clips for cable ties

- Suggest removing extra HDMI cable - wire bench to podium input
## Proposed New Equipment
- [HD-TX-4KZ-421-CHGR €908](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/DM-Essentials/Switching-Transmitters-Receivers/HD-TX-4KZ-421-CHGR)
- [DM Lite 8x2 Switcher €3350](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/DigitalMedia-Switchers/Fixed-Switchers/HD-PS622)
- [HD-RXA-4KZ-101](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RXA-4KZ-101) x2

> The HD-TX-4KZ-421-CHGR would cover all inputs down at podium and desk. Arguably the dock does all of that at the moment.


> Switcher could provide second output for foldback or recording if needed. A DA would probably suffice for the time being though.


> One receiver for the projector and to provide control to it.
> One receiver for foldback screen on stage,
