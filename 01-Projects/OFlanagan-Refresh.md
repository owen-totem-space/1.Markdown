## Clean Rack & Replace Network Switch
- [Rack Mounted Power Strip](https://ie.farnell.com/lms-data/pdu-6ws-h/6-way-horizontal-13a-switched/dp/3761838)
- [NETGEAR GS116PP](https://www.elara.ie/productdetail.aspx?manufacturer=NETGEAR&mancode=GS116PP-100EUS&productcode=MME0714416)
- Buy new Cat6 Cables
- Make XLR Loom for radios?

## Podium
- Mount Laptop Dock in better position inside podium
- Loom and clean cables inside podium

## Proposed New Equipment
- [HD-TX-4KZ-421-CHGR €908](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/DM-Essentials/Switching-Transmitters-Receivers/HD-TX-4KZ-421-CHGR)
- [DM Lite 8x2 Switcher €3350](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/DigitalMedia-Switchers/Fixed-Switchers/HD-PS622)
- [HD-RXA-4KZ-101](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RXA-4KZ-101) x2

> The HD-TX-4KZ-421-CHGR would cover all inputs down at podium and desk. Arguably the dock does al that at the moment.


> Switcher could provide second output for foldback or recording if needed. A DA would probably suffice for the time being though.


> One receiver for the projector and to provide control to it.
> One receiver for foldback screen on stage,
