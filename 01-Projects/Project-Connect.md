## Digital Signage

Digital Signage Screens
- Should Crestron Compatible screens be specified for digital signage. We could have visibility and power scheduling. Network point for the screen just has to be provided.

Touchpads for room booking
- If these are crestron touchpads, we would have visibility and ability to update firmware and configure hardware or software updates. These could all be scheduled and distributed together. Are they compatible with current systems?
