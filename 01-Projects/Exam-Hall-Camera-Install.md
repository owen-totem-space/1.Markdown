## List of works to be completed

### Cameras

- Provide and run HD-SDI cable from camera to wall box
- Terminate SDI cable to camera and inside wall box at cabinet
- Supply 1U panel for wall box with 6 SDI connectors and blanks for other ports of panel
- 3 SDI for camera
- 3 SDI for wall plates
-

- Connect 3 Camera SDI ports to black magic box (SDI – HDMI) in the rack.
- Supply 1U panel for cabinet rack with 3 HDMI ports (can be HDMI back to back). Fed from black magic boxes.
- Cat6 cable for camera is in place, on top of wooden surround. This may need to be extended down to camera position. I’m unsure whether it is terminated with a male or female connector.
- Cameras to be installed at bottom of wooden surround, upside down, at same level as audio speakers.
- Cameras and controller to be connected to college network and configured for use. Ports or switch will be provided.
- I can provide a Roland VR50HD switcher for testing of camera signals and controller during install, if you wish.

##### Ports On Wall
- Supply 3 Wall plates with SDI connector
- My preference would be for wall plates in style of below pic

### Wall plates can replace current wall plates. Pics below

##### Wall Plate 1 – current plate is not in use

##### Wall Plate 2 – current plate is not in use

##### Wall Plate 3

- My preference for this wall plate rather than add another single gang plate beside it, would be to replace this with a 2 port single gang like in the picture above and re-terminate the cat6 to an ethercon and add SDI connector.
