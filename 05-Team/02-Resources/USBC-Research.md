## Description

Examine methods to provide USBC connections in both existing and new rooms.

---

## Method-1-Dongle-&-Cable

This is the most basic approach. Current HDMI cables could be adapted by locking dongles onto the end of them. Alternatively provide a USBC - HDMI cable in position. 

> [!NOTE]
> - Pros
>   - Cheap if not buying cables
> 
> - Cons
>   - Unreliable
>   - Cannot provide power to device

- [Dongle Lock]
- [Crestron USBC-HDMI Cable]
- [Crestron USBC - UCBC Cable]

## Method-2-Laptop-Dock
This method involves using currently provided laptop docks as the interface between the user and the HDMI cable.


> [!NOTE]
> - Pros
>   - Can provide power
>   - Mid range cost
> 
> - Cons
>   - Power cable and DC adapter are large
>   - Likely need to provide USBC extension cable

## Method-3-AV-Converters&Switchers
> [!CAUTION]
> Not all switching & converting devices provide USB power, many have a separate model denoted as "with USBC charging".

#### Replace HDMI directly
This device from extron is the AV equivalent of providing a dock. These would be useful devices for us to have in stock. A bit more robust and all cables are replaceable.

#### Solely providing a USBC port. 
The following works for a lot of situation. It would require the switcher near the screen connected via HDMI (or further away using HDMI-Cat6 converters). It would provide a local HDMI connection near the switcher. It would have a remote USBC connection, connected to the switcher via Cat6 (DMPS Lite).

## Conclusion
[Method 1 - Dongle](#Method%201%20-%20Dongle) shouldn't be anything but a short term fix for people who have no HDMI option available.

While [Method 2 - Laptop Dock](#Method%202%20-%20Laptop%20Dock) may seem tempting, the costs around extra cabling and the inconvenience of the power supplies and cabling options, may not outweigh some of the options in [Method 3 - AV Converters & Switchers](#Method%203%20-%20AV%20Converters%20&%20Switchers)

#### Power
[Method 1 - Dongle](#Method%201%20-%20Dongle) cannot provide power to a device and should be avoided. Not all switching & converting devices provide power, many have a separate model denoted as "with USBC charging".

Separate USBC ports, solely for charging, can of course be provided by cable caddies etc. But it's not really practical to have to plug in 2 USBC cables if you need to charge.
