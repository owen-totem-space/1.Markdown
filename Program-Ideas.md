An upskilled sector
We have effectively moved up the value chain from service provider to technology provider. We now have the skillset and tech within RCSI to solidify the technology and create a pathway to sustainability. This requires a pathway for people to acquire the skills and maintain the systems. Once this area of the department is solidified, other relationships will develop and we can try move up the value chain again if required, however this next move is likely a broader aquisition of skills, linux admin etc ...

### Programming Approach
- I've built a module to take care of the "extra RCSI stuff", this takes care of the business inside of the program. I can also provide and customise the XIO backend.
- I've built a frontend that is built with UX and technical functionality in mind
- Only the middle bit of connecting the devices remains, which is what we currently have in place.
- This mid-section with the device logic can remain the same whilst all business end and UI/UX can change. RCSI are now in control of the device logic and have added value on the front and backend.

### Networking approach
- outsource responsibility to kevin
- work with IT to establish clear direction on purchasing and implementation

Both of these will reduce friction for everybody, external designers and suppliers included. We have removed any responsibility outside device connection.
